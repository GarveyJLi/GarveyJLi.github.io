        <p>
          Hi, I'm Garvey Li, a recent Data Science graduate from UC San Diego with a passion for machine learning, statistical analysis, and solving real-world problems through data. 
          I'm especially drawn to projects that blend experimentation with meaningful impact—whether that’s training music-generating transformers, finding patterns in genetic data relating to various diseases, 
          or detecting malformed dinosaur-shaped chicken nuggets.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently a Bioinformatics Research Assistant at <a href="http://glasslab.ucsd.edu/index.html" style="text-decoration: underline;">Glass Labs</a>, 
          where I apply transformer-based models to study how patterns in DNA relate to key genetic features involved in immunity and inflammatory diseases. 
          This work aims to uncover mechanisms that influence conditions such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, and neurodegenerative disorders.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my work in bioinformatics, I’ve applied data science and machine learning across a range of fields—including finance, music, and computer vision.
          Previously, I interned at Franklin Templeton, where I analyzed technical stock indicators across economic cycles to assess their robustness during major market events, 
          supporting research into their predictive power and limitations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of industry, I’ve led and contributed to a variety of creative data projects, including training a GPT-2 model to generate ragtime music, 
          and winning 1st place at DS3 DataHacks with an anomaly detection pipeline for chicken nugget shapes.  
        </p>
